# Breathee - what is that?

A responsive web application providing user with immediate help in case of stress or anxiety, or focus issues.
After clicking Start on home screen, the screen is filled with a calming, circular animation, which takes user's focus away from worries, to the current moment.
Live, dynamic instructions appearing on screen guide the user through exercises based on box breathing technique - inhaling, exhaling and holding breath in between.
The breathing assistant can be stopped anytime user clicks the Feeling better? button. Otherwhise, the exercise takes up about 2.5 mins and then the home screen appears back again.
Additionaly, the website is equiped with About page, containing information about the app and instructions on where to seek help in a mental health crisis (when the self-calming techniques are not enough to relieve too).

Deployed online, Breathee can be accesed anywhere on Earth, on a computer or mobile devices.
